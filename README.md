|The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators                         |The Agile involves continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC process. Both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the waterfall model. This software development method emphasizes on incremental, iterative, and evolutionary development.                              |
| DevOps promotes collaboration between Development and Operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. | It breaks the product into small pieces and integrates them for final testing. It can be implemented in many ways, such as Kanban, XP, Scrum, etc. |


## Continuous integration
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run. Automated tools are used to assert the new code’s correctness before integration.

## Continuous Delivery
Continuous delivery is an ongoing DevOps practice of building, testing, staging and production improvements to software code and user environments with the help of automated tools. In CD, the staging process is manually done.

## Continuous Deployment
Continuous deployment is basically when teams rely on a fully-automated pipeline. This practice fully eliminates any manual steps and automates the entire process. Therefore, continuous deployment ensures that code is continuously being pushed into production. 

## Benefits of Cloud 

### Cost Savings
Cost saving is one of the biggest Cloud Computing benefits. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not need any physical hardware investments. Also, you do not need trained personnel to maintain the hardware. The buying and managing of equipment is done by the cloud service provider.

### Strategic edge
Cloud computing offers a competitive edge over your competitors. It is one of the best advantages of Cloud services that helps you to access the latest applications any time without spending your time and money on installations.

### High Speed
Cloud computing allows you to deploy your service quickly in fewer clicks. This faster deployment allows you to get the resources required for your system within fewer minutes.

### Back-up and restore data
Once the data is stored in a Cloud, it is easier to get the back-up and recovery of that, which is otherwise very time taking process on-premise.

### Automatic Software Integration
In the cloud, software integration is something that occurs automatically. Therefore, you don’t need to take additional efforts to customize and integrate your applications as per your preferences.

### Reliability
Reliability is one of the biggest benefits of Cloud hosting. You can always get instantly updated about the changes.

### Mobility
Employees who are working on the premises or at the remote locations can easily access all the could services. All they need is an Internet connectivity.

### Unlimited storage capacity
The cloud offers almost limitless storage capacity. At any time you can quickly expand your storage capacity with very nominal monthly fees.
