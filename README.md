|The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators                         |The Agile involves continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC process. Both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the waterfall model. This software development method emphasizes on incremental, iterative, and evolutionary development.                              |
| DevOps promotes collaboration between Development and Operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. | It breaks the product into small pieces and integrates them for final testing. It can be implemented in many ways, such as Kanban, XP, Scrum, etc. |


## Continuous integration
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run. Automated tools are used to assert the new code’s correctness before integration.

## Continuous Delivery
Continuous delivery is an ongoing DevOps practice of building, testing, staging and production improvements to software code and user environments with the help of automated tools. In CD, the staging process is manually done.

## Continuous Deployment
Continuous deployment is basically when teams rely on a fully-automated pipeline. This practice fully eliminates any manual steps and automates the entire process. Therefore, continuous deployment ensures that code is continuously being pushed into production.
