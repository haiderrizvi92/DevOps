|The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators                         |The Agile involves continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC process. Both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the waterfall model. This software development method emphasizes on incremental, iterative, and evolutionary development.                              |
| DevOps promotes collaboration between Development and Operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. | It breaks the product into small pieces and integrates them for final testing. It can be implemented in many ways, such as Kanban, XP, Scrum, etc. |
